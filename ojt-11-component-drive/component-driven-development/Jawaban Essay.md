### SOAL ESSAY

#### 1. How does Component-Driven Development (CDD) benefit the development process?

> > > Faster and Efficient Development Process

Component-Driven Development (CDD) effectively decouples the development process. As each component is built independently, teams can work on their separate components without being reliant on others.

And since components can be reused, the whole development process is drastically faster. Instead of building pages individually, you can quickly assemble them from your component library.
Efficient Testing

When the system is divided into separate components, it’s easier to test the functionality of each component. You can ensure that every component functions correctly before integrating it into the larger system. It also allows you to isolate bugs by testing at the component level. It’s faster and takes less effort when debugging code compared to testing pages or full user interfaces.

- Easier Maintenance

The modular structure of CDD allows you to replace or update components without affecting the rest of the system. So, when you want to change a specific part of your application, you can easily update that component without modifying other parts of the application. When issues with bugs come up, they can be easily traced back to a specific component which significantly reduces the time spent on debugging and fixing bugs.

- Improved Scalability

Each component can be designed to handle increasing loads or replicated to handle more use cases. As your project expands, you can add or reuse new components without interfering with the overall functionality.

- Enhanced UX

Building with components means you don’t have to run the risk of inconsistent user experiences. This is especially true with large projects that spread over multiple platforms. By reusing the same components, you can create and maintain a UI/UX that is distinctly yours.

#### 2. What is the role of components in CDD?

> > > If your goal is to build software that is scalable, adaptable, and easy to maintain, Component-Driven Development (CDD) is the ideal approach. By embracing modularity and breaking down applications into manageable components, you can establish an efficient, collaborative, and future-proof development process.

#### 3. What is the basic workflow for component-driven development in React using Storybook?

> > > Component-driven development (CDD) in React using Storybook follows a workflow designed to promote the isolation, development, testing, and documentation of individual UI components. Here's the basic workflow:

    Setup Storybook: Begin by setting up Storybook in your React project if you haven't already done so. You can use the Storybook CLI or install it manually. Storybook provides a development environment and a UI component library for your React components.

    Create Stories: Once Storybook is set up, start creating "stories" for your React components. A story represents a single state or use case of a component. Stories are typically written in separate files alongside the component code. Each story file typically imports the component and then defines different states or variations of the component using Storybook's APIs.

    Develop Components: With Storybook and stories in place, you can now develop your React components in isolation. This means you can focus on one component at a time, without needing to set up complex application state or navigate through different parts of your application.

#### 4. What are the advantages of using Styled Components over traditional CSS?

> > >     Hassle-free theme development and maintenance.

    No more unmanageable code.
    Implement conditional and dynamic styling effortlessly.
    No worries about unique class names.

#### 5. How do you handle media queries with Styled Components?

- 1. Define breakpoints

The first step should be a definition of the supported screen sizes in your application. As the needs in applications are different, a good starting point are the standard breakpoints in Google Chrome Dev Tools. Add or subtract breakpoints as for your specific need.

- 2. Define devices

Based on the sizes we can create a media query for each supported device. We can improve readability of the code, when using ES6 template strings.

- 3. Apply media query in styled-component
     To apply the media query in a styled component just add it to the styling. Let’s consider the following application.
